            What is pregnancy abortion?
        </p>
        <p>
            Pregnancy abortion is the termination of an embryo or fetus from the uterus.

        If an abortion occurs without inducement it's referred to as a “miscarriage”. If effort is made to bring about an abortion it's referred to as “induced abortion.”
        </p>
        <h5>
            Abortion pill/medical abortion
        </h5>
        <p>Medical abortion is the process where a pregnant woman uses pills/tablets to end a pregnancy. Medical abortion is safe and more effective in the first trimester of a pregnancy (early stages).</p>

        <p>A medical abortion does not require any kind of surgery and neither does it require any anesthesia, it can be done at the comfort of one's home.</p>
            
        <p>However medical abortion/abortion pill is not recommended if a woman is under the following conditions;</p><br>
            
        1.Ectopic pregnancy, If the pregnancy is more than three months,  If you have an ongoing medical condition like; heart disease, bleeding disorders, kidney or lung disease, uncontrolled seizures,
        If you have allergies with the medicine used, that's mifepristone and misoprostol (cytotec 200 mcg),
        In such conditions a surgical abortion (dilation & curettage) alternative should be applied.
            <br>
        <p>Types of medications and procedures for a medical abortion/abortion pill</p>
        <h5>Mifepristone (RU 486) and Misoprostol (cytotec 200mcg)-MIFE-KIT</h5>
        <img src="../images/IMG_3702.jpeg" width="400px" height="450px">
        <p>This is a combination of two medications, mifepristone which blocks the hormone progesterone hence stopping the growth of the fetus by preventing it from staying implanted on the uterus and misoprostol which contracts the walls of the uterus hence flushing out the fetus through the vagina.</p>
        <h5>Oral misoprostol</h5>
        <img src="../images/IMG_3743.jpeg" width="400px" height="400px">
        <p>Misoprostol is sold under brand name cytotec200mcg or Misoclear; it's mostly used to terminate unwanted pregnancy in the 1st trimester of a pregnancy.

            The abortion is done by placing the misoprostol pills under the tongue to dissolve as one swallows the solvent. The process takes about to 30 minutes before all the pills dissolve and the results take effect in an average of 1 to 2 hours, although there can be a delay in some individuals the window for the result is 24 hours after orally taking misoprostol.
        </p>
        <p>Vaginal and oral misoprostol</p>

        <p>This is the process where some pills of misoprostol are placed under the tongue and some are placed in the vaginal route.</p>
            
        <p>This kind of procedure reduces side effects and more effective on early pregnancies.</p>
            
        <h5>Methotrexate</h5>
            
        <P>This is given in form of a shot and is used to terminate ectopic pregnancies (tubal pregnancy), methotrexate takes a while before it completes the abortion and it must be administered with some vaginal misoprostol.</p>
        <h5>Vaginal misoprostol/Misoclear</h5>
        <img src="../images/aaf768f9-d213-4c7a-ba65-be9fe12e3607.jpeg" width="600px" height="500px">
        <p>This is the process where misoprostol is only placed in the vaginal route, it should be used in abortion of very early pregnancies and its less effective compared to the other methods of medical abortion.</p>
        <h5>How to know that an abortion has been successful</h5>
        <p>In most cases it's easy for one to tell that the abortion was successful when some of the symptoms like nausea and breast tenderness begin to disappear within days after abortion and in some situations one is able to see the embryonic sac during the bleeding, but it's very important for one to; carry out a urine pregnancy test weeks after the abortion to confirm if it's a negative test result.</p>
        <p>In some cases one needs to take an ultra sound test to confirm whether the abortion was successful or not, the ultra sound test is much effective and gives the result as soon as the abortion is completed.</p>
        <p>After abortion it might take about 2 to 3 weeks in some cases for ovulation to occur even before your period starts, so it's safe to use contraceptive methods to prevent conception.</p>    
        <h5>EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTIVES/EMERGENCY PILLS</h5>
        <p>Emergency contraceptive pills or morning-after pills are used to delay or disrupt ovulation in women hence preventing unwanted pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Emergency pills are only effective to prevent unwanted pregnancy only in 72 hours after unprotected sex. Emergency contraceptives cannot terminate an already established pregnancy, so for emergency pills to be effective, they should be swallowed as soon as possible after unprotected sex.</p>
